# Image Process Project

This is the project for Backend Development with Node.js in Udacity's Full-Stack JavaScript Development Nanodegree. I build a React front end and a backend server with Node.js for the application. I mainly used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) for the backend server. For the frontend, I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [React-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) to bootstrap this project.

## Get Started

- To get this project, type `git clone https://github.com/cheerworld/imageProcessAPI.git` in your terminal and `cd imageProcess` to get into your project.

To get started developing right away:

- Install and start the API server

  - `cd ImageProcessAPI`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run start`
  - you can test the ImageProcessAPI server with `npm run test`
  - you can prettier server code with `npm run prettier` and eslint code with `npm run lint`

- In another terminal window
  - `cd frontend`
  - install all project dependencies with `npm install/yarn add`
  - start the development server with `npm/yarn start`
